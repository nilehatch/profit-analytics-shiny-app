Is that accurate? I have some concerns that the sensing would malfunction.

","From what I understand, the mobile app supports the physical tool. Due to the concerns I voiced in my response to the ""dislike"" section, I wouldn't buy the product because I have multiple vitamin containers and don't use an organizer so the tool could (as far as I understand) only monitor one of my vitamins----which in a pinch might be nice but it's not enough to convince me to buy it. 
I wonder if the tool and app could be programmed to remind me to take my vitamins and then have a button on the tool (and in the app) that I could push (or--in the app--slide) to indicate that I took them. Then, if I didn't click/slide the button, the app would know I hadn't taken them and would remind me through the alarm and other notifications?

Sorry. I carry my meds with me in a pill bottle or shove my entire weekly box in my backpack because I need to take them within a specific time window and I am rarely in the same location when that happens. I am often late, and sometimes miss, but not because I forget. I remember a dozen times, but literally am so busy that I don't feel like I have the time to go find a cup of water with a straw. If I kept one with a filled gallon of water in my car, in my bedroom, at my work desk, and in both work trucks, that would solve all of my issues.","For me? Make it fully portable and small enough to fit inside the pockets of skinny jeans - millimeters larger than a pill bottle. I'd be willing to dump my daily into a pill bottle if there was an audible awful alarm that would go off until I took it. Make it a two part device - the bottom part goes on the bottom of the pill bottle, and the top snaps into a cap that fits a pill bottle... since for some reason all the bottles aren't the same. To turn off the alarm you have to pull the bottom piece out of the pill bottle and stick it in the lid. Which means emptying the pills out. Same diff as your weight sensor. Tell people to put a day's worth in the bottle. It would have to be super small though, or come as a cap/bottle combo. Which would work. People like personalization, and taking meds IRL can be sorta scary if you wonder if people wonder what you're taking. Customization of the bottle would be compelling for people. I would pay marginally more for a color that wasn't pill bottle yellow / white. And you could make it look cool and still be child proof. You'll have to get the entire assembly tested to be CPSC child safe and senior friendly unless you find a closure you can screen print. I'd say find one that comes premade and has enough space built in to also integrate your timer + screech alarm, use that as a minimum viable test product. Then build a sleek streamlined product (that isn't gonna fall out of my shorts into the side of my car because it's so smooth it slides) that comes in favorite colors with dark ""I'm pretty but you don't HAVE to look at me"" tones and maybe some ""I'm interesting and I WANT you to ask"" neon eye bleed ones or work with some random artist that appeals to that kinda crowd (I mean there are entire stores that sell art... or religious candles... and they somehow pay rent). I'd go for a steel blue gray with a matte metallic finish, with a mildly textured surface like the skin of a bumpy orange. I kid myself that I'd want the weight of metal, but I also am gonna have it in the same pocket as my phone and that's gonna be a noise mess and scratch my screen protector. So plastic that looks nice, sturdy enough that it doesn't flex in my pocket, light enough that it doesn't bounce as I run.
